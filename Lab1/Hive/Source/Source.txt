Enter into hive using Hive command.
Create database called hivedb in hive using below command:
create database hivedb;
After creating the database we need to use the same for creating the table by using below command:
use hivedb;

Create a table called heroes_info using the below command:
create table heroes_info(id int, name string, gender string, eyecolor string, race string, haircolor string, height int, publisher string, skincolor string, alignment string, weight int) row format delimited fields terminated by ‘,’ stored as textfile;

Load the heroes_information.csv into the newly created table heroes_info using following command:
load data local inpath‘/home/cloudera/Downloads/heroes_information’ into table heroes_info; Query the heroes_info table to check the data has been loaded into table using below command: select * from heroes_info; Screenshot

Repeat the above steps for creating a table called super_hero_powers and load the data in to it.

Query1:
Select sum(weight) from heroes_info where height>100;

Query2:
Select name,height from heroes_info order by height desc limit 10;

Query3:
Select concat(gender,"--",height) from heroes_info where haircolor="No Hair";

Query4:
Select avg(height) from heroes_info where gender="Female";

Query5:
Select name from heroes_info where height between 150 and 160;

Query6:
Select gender, case when gender = 'Male' then 'male_gender' else 'female_gender' end from heroes_info;

Query7:
Select a.name,a.haircolor,b.energy_absorption from heroes_info a join super_hero_powers b on a.name=b.hero_name where b.energy_absorption == "TRUE";

Query8:
Create table joined_table (hero_name string, eyecolor string, agility string, durabililty string)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
stored as textfile;

Insert into table joined_table select a.name,a,eyecolor,b.agility,b.durability from heroes_info a join super_hero_powers b on a.name=b.hero_name;
Select *from joined_table;

Query9:
Select count(id) from heroes_info where (height between 170 and 200) and (weight between 50 and 100);

Query10:
select name from heroes_info where publisher like '%comics%';
